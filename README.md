UPDATE: I have no fucking idea how to add a github repo, so just DM me on Discord or something for the files. AAAAAAAAAAAA

Hey, welcome to the gitrepo of this small mod!
</br>Most of the assets here are directly from the Kade Engine repo so if you want to make a mod similar to this, I recommend you download the Kade Engine repository instead.
</br>If you want to use some of my assets or code, you can just get them here easy peasy. Some of my stuff here is very messy like the .fla files. So I'm sorry if this sucks.
